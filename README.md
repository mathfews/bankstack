# BankStack - Terminal Banking System in Python
BankStack is a terminal-based banking system developed in Python to simulate core backend operations such as authentication, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, with persistent data storage.

This project was built to practice backend logic, data persistence, and system structure design.
